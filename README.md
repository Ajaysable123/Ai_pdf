# **My Project - RAG intergrated with slack**

This project demonstrates how to integrate with the Pinecone and OpenAI APIs to extract, chunk, and embed text data, followed by storing and querying data in a Pinecone vector database.

## **Prerequisites**

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- Access to OpenAI API
- Access to Pinecone API

---

## **Installation**

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project-name.git
   cd project-name
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install additional dependencies**:
   Make sure to install the following Python libraries if they are not in the `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv openai pinecone-client pandas
   ```

---

## **Environment Variables**

This project uses environment variables to store sensitive API keys. Ensure you have a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```bash
# .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_pinecone_environment
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=your_pinecone_index_name
SLACK_CHANNEL=your_slack_channel_id
```

### **.env File Details**:

- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Your OpenAI API key for embedding queries and using Chat models.
- **PINECONE_API_KEY**: Your Pinecone API key to connect to the vector database.
- **PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT**: The Pinecone environment you're using (e.g., `us-east1-gcp`).
- **PINECONE_INDEX_NAME**: The name of your Pinecone index (e.g., `slck`).
- **SLACK_CHANNEL**: Slack channel information if needed for future integrations.

## **Usage**

### **1. Extract and Chunk Text Data**

This script extracts text data from a PDF file, chunks it, and prepares it for embedding and storage in a Pinecone vector database.

```python
# Run the text extraction and chunking
python src/data_extraction.py
```

### **2. Insert Embeddings into Pinecone**

Insert the chunked data into Pinecone using embeddings generated by OpenAI.

```python
# Insert data into Pinecone
python src/pinecone_interaction.py
```

### **3. Query Data from Pinecone**

You can query the vector database with a natural language query, and Pinecone will return the most relevant chunk based on vector similarity.

```python
# Query Pinecone and get results
python src/model_inference.py
```

---

## **Testing**

You can run the tests using `pytest` or any other testing framework you're comfortable with.

To install `pytest`:
```bash
pip install pytest
```

Run all tests:
```bash
pytest
```

---

## **Deployment (Optional)**

To deploy this project in a production environment, ensure the following:

- Sensitive data is secured (use secret managers or environment variables).
- The app is containerized (e.g., using Docker).
- Proper logging and monitoring are in place.
- Set up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automatic testing and deployment.

## **License**

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

By following the steps above, you will have a production-grade project for working with OpenAI embeddings and Pinecone vectors.
